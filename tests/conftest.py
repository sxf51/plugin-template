"""Fixtures, and the one line that decides which host backend runs.

`select_host()` in `harness/host.py` walks up for the project's source and
actually imports it before committing. Source on disk is not enough: running
from the plugin's own environment finds the project above but has none of its
dependencies installed.

    uv run pytest plugins/plugin-template/tests   # project env -> real host
    cd plugins/plugin-template && uv run pytest   # plugin env  -> stand-in
    cd <copied-out plugin> && uv run pytest       # no source   -> stand-in

Every run says which backend it used, so a fallback is never silent, and prints
the plugin's capability inventory at the end.
